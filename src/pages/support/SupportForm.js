        At Rooster we are happy to help, but please keep in mind that this is a
        humble web application. We are run by a handful of students that simply
        wanted to give something cool to the CCU community. For free and
        currently with no ads. If you experience issues, need support, or would
        like to give us feedback we would love to hear it. Your patience is
        appreciated.
